Place your background image here using the name `achievements_bg.png`.

Recommended size: 1920x1080 or similar wide aspect ratio. The application will scale the image to fit the Achievements view.

Path (project root): `assets/achievements_bg.png`

If the file exists, the Achievements page will use it as the background; otherwise a fallback solid color is used.
